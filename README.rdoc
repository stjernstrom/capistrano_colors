== DESCRIPTION

The aim of capistrano_colors is to make the capistrano output more userfriendly.
When capistrano_colors is included in your deploy.rb capistrano output gets nice and shiny colors.

== INSTALLATION

   sudo gem install capistrano_colors

  In config/deploy.rb

   require 'capistrano_colors'


=== System wide installation

  Create/Modify you ~/.caprc with the following

== Creating you own color matchers

 Create a custom colormatcher with the colorize command.
 colorize can be called with a hash of options or an array of hashes.
  
 The options hash should have the following fields.
  
 * :match     - A regular expression of the row to match.
 * :color     - The color we want on the matching rows.
 * :prio      - What prio should this rule have (higher = more prio)
 * :attribute - Special effect (:underline, :reverse, :blink)
 * :level     - Specify if this matcher should be bound to some of capistranos log levels (info,debug,...) 
 * :prepend   - Text to be prepended to the output
 * :timestamp - Show current time with the output

=== match 
 :match is a simple regular expression for the row that should be matched.

=== color
 :color can have the following values:

 * :hide  (hides the row completely)
 * :none
 * :black
 * :red
 * :green
 * :yellow
 * :blue
 * :magenta
 * :cyan
 * :white

=== prio
  :prio is a Integer defining the matchers prio.

=== attribute
 :attribute can have the following values:

 * :bright
 * :dim
 * :underscore
 * :blink
 * :reverse
 * :hidden

     { :match => /command finished/,       :color => :hide,      :prio => 10 },
     { :match => /executing command/,      :color => :blue,      :prio => 10, :attribute => :underscore },
     { :match => /^transaction: commit$/,  :color => :magenta,   :prio => 10, :attribute => :blink },
     { :match => /git/,                    :color => :white,     :prio => 20, :attribute => :reverse },
